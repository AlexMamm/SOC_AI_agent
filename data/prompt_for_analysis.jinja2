You are a senior SOC analyst. Below are raw security events and threat intelligence from VirusTotal.

Your task:
1. Reconstruct the attack chain.
2. Identify tactics, techniques, and impact.
3. Generate a structured incident report in JSON format with:
   - "risk_level": "Critical", "High", or "Medium"
   - "attack_stages": list of MITRE ATT&CK-like stages (e.g., "Initial Access", "Execution", "C2", "Exfiltration")
   - "narrative": a concise 3–5 sentence summary in Russian
   - "recommendations": list of 3–5 actionable steps in Russian

Do not invent facts. Use only the provided data.

Raw events:
{% for ev in events %}
- {{ ev.message }}
{% endfor %}

VirusTotal findings:
- Malicious hashes (malicious > 3): {{ malicious_hashes }}
- Malicious IPs (malicious > 2): {{ malicious_ips }}

Now output ONLY a valid JSON object. No explanations.
